# This file generates the GitHub Actions matrix.
# For simple board + shield combinations, add them to the top level board and
# shield arrays, for more control, add individual board + shield combinations
# to the `include` property. You can also use the `cmake-args` property to
# pass flags to the build command and `artifact-name` to assign a name to
# distinguish build outputs from each other:
#
#board: [ "nice_nano_v2" ]
#shield: [ "kyria_rev3_left", "kyria_rev3_right", "settings_reset" ]
